**NOTE 1:**
Fail-fast means when you try to modify the content when you are iterating thru it, it will fail and throw ConcurrentModificationException.

Set keys = hashMap.keySet();
for (Object key : keys) {
    hashMap.put(someObject, someValue); //it will throw the ConcurrentModificationException here
} 
For HashTable enumeration:

 Enumeration keys = hashTable.keys();
 while (keys.hasMoreElements()) {
          hashTable.put(someKey, someValue);  //this is ok
    }
    
    The Hastable's iterators are fail-fast. Its enumerations are not.
